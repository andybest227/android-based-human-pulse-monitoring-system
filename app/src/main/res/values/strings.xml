        "Instant Heart Rate measures your heart rate by analyzing color changes on the tip of your finger.\n\n"

        "Gently place the tip of your finger on the camera so it completely covers the lens. "
        "It is not necessary to cover the flash. Hold your phone steady. \n\n"

        "Heart Rate Zones.\n\n"

        "Heart Rate is the number of heart beats per unit of time, typically expressed as "
        "beat per minutes (bpm).\n\n"

        "Warm Up.\n\n"

        "132bpm - 144bpm "
        "50-60% of heart rate reserve "
        "This zone is the least intense. You are in it just to warm up or cool down, "
        "in order to prevent injuries.\n\n"

        "Fat Burn.\n\n"

        "144 - 156bpm "
        "60 - 70% of heart rate reserve.\n"
        "Stay in this zone if your goal is to lose weight. Your body is fueled by 10% "
        "carbohydrates, 5% protein and 85% fat.\n"
        "The actual number of calories burned per minute will be less than in higher zones, "
        "but you'll be able to maintain exercise longer.\n\n"

        "Cardio.\n\n"

        "156bpm - 168bpm \n"
        "70 - 80% of heart rate reserve \n"
        "Also called anaerobic zone. In this you'll get the greatest health benefits overall. "
        "Your heart and lung capacity will increase and your overall fitness will also increase, "
        "so you'll be able to exercise longer. Your body will get 50% of your calories from fat, "
        "50% from carbohydrates and protein burn will be minimal.\n\n"

        "Extreme.\n\n"
        "168bpm - 180bpm \n"
        "80 - 90% of heart rate reserve \n"

        "Also called anaerobic zone. This is highly intense exercise and should be limited to no "
        "more than 10-20 minutes. Your body's ability to consume oxygen will increase. \n"
        "If you push too hard your body will start producing lactic acid. Your body will burn 85% "
        "fats and minimal percentage of protein.\n\n"

        "Max.\n\n"

        "180bpm - 192bpm \n"
        "You are pushing your heart to the limits here and should consult your doctor to check "
        "if you can exercise in this zone safely. \n\n"

        "Heart rate zones in this app are calculated using Detection Algorithm .\n\n"
